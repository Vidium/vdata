In this section, we will go through the main objects defined in the VData library :

- [`Time Point`](./timepoint.md) introduces objects for efficient time management
- [`TemporalDataFrame`](./tdf.md) introduces an extension of `pandas.DataFrames` to a third time axis
- [`VData`](./vdata.md) introduces the main object of the library, dedicated to storing and manipulating large quantities of annotated
and time-stamped data. It is an expansion of `AnnData` objects.
- [`Compatibility with the scverse`](./compatibility.md) presents how `VData` objects can be used with common tools of the scverse for
bioinformatics analysis.
